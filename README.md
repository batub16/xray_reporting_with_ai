# AI MRI Report Project

This project aims to develop an AI application that analyzes MRI images and generates corresponding medical reports. The project utilizes a dataset consisting of nearly 7000 MRI images and their associated reports.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is publicly available at [OpenI](https://openi.nlm.nih.gov/). It contains a rich collection of MRI images and their corresponding textual reports.

## Project Structure

- `ai_report_project.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `data/`: Directory containing the MRI images and reports (Note: Add instructions on how to download and organize this data).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Necessary Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai_mri_report_project.git
    cd ai_mri_report_project
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook ai_report_project.ipynb
    ```

2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate the results.
